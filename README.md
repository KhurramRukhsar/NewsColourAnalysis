# 🎨 Emotional Impact of Colors in News Media

This project analyzes how colors used in news broadcasts can influence stress, arousal, and emotional responses in viewers. Using **Librosa** for audio analysis and **Matplotlib** for visualization, we map news segments to their dominant color associations and study their psychological impact.

## 📊 Example Results
Color Distribution in News Segments

Pie chart showing percentage of time each color dominated in visuals:

Red & Yellow dominate — both are highly stimulating and linked with urgency, anger, and stress.

Blue & Green appear sparingly — typically associated with calm, but underused in heated debates.

Black & White backgrounds — add contrast but can increase visual harshness when combined with red.

## 🧠 Key Insights

News channels deliberately use stimulating colors (reds, yellows, flashing contrasts) to hold attention.

Psychological research links these colors with increased arousal, stress, and aggressive emotions.

The analysis suggests that design choices, not just content, shape emotional reactions to news.

## 📝 Article Excerpt

“The ‘Code Red’ of our times isn’t just about breaking news; it’s about how the very design of the screen manipulates our emotions. Viewers walk away not more informed, but more agitated. Awareness is the first step to breaking the cycle.”

## 📌 Next Steps

Expand dataset with multiple channels.

Automate color extraction from frames.

Combine with audio sentiment analysis for multimodal insights.
