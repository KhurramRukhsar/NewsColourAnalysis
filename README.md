ðŸŽ¨ News Media Color Analysis

This project analyzes the use of colors in news media broadcasts to understand how visual design choices (such as flashing graphics, background colors, and overlays) may contribute to heightened emotional responses in viewers.

By extracting frame-by-frame color distributions from a news video, we generate data visualizations (stacked area charts, pie charts, etc.) that reveal the dominance of specific colors (such as Red and Black) often linked to urgency, fear, and outrage.
